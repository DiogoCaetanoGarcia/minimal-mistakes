</p>

Point clouds are 3D representations of real-world objects, people and scenes, which can be conveyed in real time to remote locations, enabling free-viewpoint viewing and rich collaboration as if all parties were co-located. The Group has developed [compression technology](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/ieee_tip_raht3d.pdf) that is currently adopted by MPEGâ€™s [Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) standard](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8571288). Other research topics include:

* [Plenoptic point cloud coding](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/ieee_tip2018_plenopticpc.pdf)
* [Geometry coding](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8957232)
* [Super resolution](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/icip2018_tiagoSR.pdf)
* [3D saliency maps](http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/MMSP2020_vitor.pdf)
