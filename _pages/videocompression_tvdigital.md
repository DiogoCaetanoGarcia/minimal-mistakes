The University of Brasilia was paramount in the studies that led to the Brazilian Digital Television System (SBTVD). In particular we are mostly responsible for the adoption of the H.264/AVC video compression standard as opposed to the then aged H.262/MPEG-2 which was being used in the competing standards. Many meetings were carried with many authorities and a Japanese delegation. In the end, the Japanese system was adopted. However, the ISDB-T system was adopted with H.264/AVC instead of H.262/MPEG-2! This made the Brazilian system unique, the ISDB-TB. Eventually ISDB-T was adopted in most other countries in South and Latin America.
