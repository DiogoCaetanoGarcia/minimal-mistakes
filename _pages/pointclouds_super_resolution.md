  <i>Super-resolution framework (SR) that outputs a superresolved frame by exploring the high-frequency content similarities between a down-sampled point-cloud and a time-adjacent frame.</i><br>
</p>

The Group proposed a mixed-resolution point-cloud representation and a super-resolution framework, from which several processing tools can be derived, such as compression, denoising and error concealment. The proposed super-resolution methods work by inferring the high-frequency content of low-resolution frames based on (a) the similarities between adjacent full-resolution frames and (b) a dictionary of low- and high-frequency pairs built from adjacent full-resolution frames.
