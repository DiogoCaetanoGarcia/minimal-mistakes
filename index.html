<i>Plenoptic point cloud</i>
Point clouds are 3D representations of real-world objects, people and scenes, which can be conveyed in real time to remote locations, enabling free-viewpoint viewing and rich collaboration as if all parties were co-located. The Group has developed <a href="http://queiroz.divp.org/papers/ieee_tip_raht3d.pdf">compression technology</a> that is currently adopted by MPEGâ€™s <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8571288">Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) standard</a>. Other research topics include:
